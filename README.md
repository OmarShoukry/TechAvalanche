# Tech Avalanche (Shopify Application)

## App Summary
This application is part of my application for Shopify's fall 2022 backend developer internship.

This app is a standard rails app built with rails 7. The focus of this app was on the backend so views are very simple HTML and CSS.

The application allows you to manage warehouse locations, products and product inventories per location.
